# BTC-Arbitrage

This project focuses on financial analysis to sort through historical trade data for Bitcoin (BTC).
To identify potential profitable arbitrage opportunities on two exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase.

## Datasets

The datasets used in this analysis are:
* Bitstamp: A dataset of bitcoin trading data from the Bitstamp exchange, covering the time period from January 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018.
* Coinbase: A dataset of bitcoin trading data from the Coinbase exchange, covering the same time period as the Bitstamp dataset.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis was conducted in several steps:

1. Data Collection: Collecting CSV data into a jupyter notebook file.
2. Data Preparation: Preparing the datasets for analysis by cleaning missing data.
3. Arbitrage calculations: identifying opportunities for arbitrage profits by comparing closing prices between the two exchanges.

## Conclusion

The analysis found opportunities for profit from price differences between two exchanges, 
especially during volatile times and early in the dataset. These opportunities could be beneficial for traders.
